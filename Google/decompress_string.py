# In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.

# Your input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:

# The input

# 3[abc]4[ab]c

# Would be output as

# abcabcabcababababc
# Other rules

# Number can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa

# One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab

# Characters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].

# Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.

# Letters are just letters.

# Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.

# Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.
# Learning objectives

# This question gives you the chance to practice with strings, recursion, algorithm, compilers, automata, and loops. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to work on coding with better efficiency.
